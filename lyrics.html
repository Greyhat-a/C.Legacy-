                Just like Delilah cut Samson’s hair<br>
                She won’t cut my anointing unfair<br>

                Her love seemed deep, deeper in me<br>
                Sometimes I felt like I couldn’t breathe<br>
                I was stuck in cycles friends couldn’t see<br>
                Lord, where would I be if You weren’t there?<br>

                My heart was made complete when I met my love His called Jesus<br>
                Never knew true love, Delilah left me a weeper<br>
                Closed my eyes, I thought I lost my lover<br>
                My kinder the never ending servant<br>
                Makes it in my heart when I’m sad he brings me laughter<br>
                Brand new love it’s true when Jesus died for sinners<br>
                Tears of joy for those who’ve seen his love in power<br>

                Christ Leaves the 99 just to look for the lost<br>
                I lost my hope he restored it in His name Holy Ghost<br>
                He told me he paid it all I asked what's the cost<br>
                He just looked me up and then he pointed at the cross<br>
                God told me he loved me I told him I love him too<br>
