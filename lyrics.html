            My heart was made complete when I met my love His called Jesus<br>
            Never knew true love, Delilah left me a weeper<br>
            Closed my eyes, I thought I lost my lover<br>
            My kinder the never ending servant<br>
            Makes it in my heart when I’m sad he brings me laughter<br>
            Brand new love it’s true when Jesus died for sinners<br>
            Tears of joy for those who’ve seen his love in power<br>

            Now I’m in this evil world trying to find my way home<br>
            Many people preaching in that am not feeling tossed<br>
            Christ Leaves the 99 just to look for the lost<br>
            I lost my hope he restored it in His name Holy Ghost<br>
            He told me he paid it all I asked what's the cost<br>
            He just looked me up and then he pointed at the cross<br>
            God told me he loved me I told him I love him too<br>
            Tall boys growing short his name Holy Ghost<br>
